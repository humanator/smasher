# smasher

AI workflow orchestration in Rust. Write your pipeline as a DOT directed graph, point it at an LLM, and run it.

Based on [attractor](https://github.com/strongdm/attractor) by [strongDM](https://www.strongdm.com/), reimplemented from scratch in Rust. The original attractor defined the idea of DOT-graph-driven AI pipelines; smasher takes that concept and rebuilds it with a layered crate architecture, multi-provider LLM support, and a web dashboard.

Five crates, bottom to top:

| Crate | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `smasher-llm` | Talks to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini through one client. Handles streaming, retries, the usual. |
| `smasher-agent` | Agent loop with tools (read, write, edit, shell, grep, glob). Steering rules, subagents, sandboxed execution. |
| `smasher-attractor` | The graph engine. Parses DOT, resolves node types from shapes, dispatches handlers, runs the pipeline. |
| `smasher-cli` | `smasher complete`, `smasher chat`, `smasher run`, `smasher serve`, `smasher resume`, `smasher render`, `smasher ingest`, `smasher archive`, `smasher lint`. |
| `smasher-web` | JSON+SSE API on port 21541 (submit, live event stream, human-gate Q&A). Serves the `smasher-spa` build at `/`. |

## Setup

You need Rust 1.85+ and at least one API key.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2389-ai/smasher.git
cd smasher
cargo build --release
```

Set a provider key (any one works, or set all three):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```

Or drop them in a `.env` file at the repo root.

## Usage

### One-shot completion

```bash
smasher complete "explain quicksort in three sentences"
smasher complete "explain quicksort" --json  # full response object
```

### Interactive chat

```bash
smasher chat
```

The chat REPL gives the agent all six tools (read, write, edit, shell, grep, glob), so it can work on files in the current directory.

### Run a pipeline

```bash
smasher run examples/old-examples/hello-world.dot
smasher run examples/old-examples/conditional.dot --var route=yes
smasher run examples/old-examples/multi-step.dot --var model=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

Pipelines are standard DOT digraphs. Node shapes tell the engine what each node does:

- `circle` / `point` = start
- `doublecircle` = exit
- `box` / `rectangle` = codergen (runs an LLM agent)
- `diamond` = conditional (branches on variables)
- `oval` / `ellipse` = interviewer (asks a human, captures response)
- `house` = manager (human approval gate)
- `parallelogram` = parallel fan-out
- `hexagon` = tool
- `component` = sub-pipeline (nested DOT file)

See [`examples/`](examples/) for working pipelines and [`docs/dot-reference.md`](docs/dot-reference.md) for the full spec.

### Web dashboard

```bash
smasher serve
# opens on http://127.0.0.1:21541
```

Submit pipelines from the browser, watch events arrive over SSE, answer human gate questions through the web UI.

## Development

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace       # ~2,700 tests
cargo clippy --workspace
```

There's a `Makefile` with shortcuts if you prefer that.
